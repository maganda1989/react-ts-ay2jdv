# react-ts-ay2jdv

Goal:
We attempted to make a react app as a portal for login to our azure environment in school project.

Result:
It did actually catch the visitor and ask them for a Microsoft login and if the RBAC allowed that account to access the website the react app would authorize the login attempt and forward them to a link that gave acccess.
